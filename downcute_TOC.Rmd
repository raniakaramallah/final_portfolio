# Introduction

# Map of Philadelphia, PA
Geo-referencing the city of Philadelphia 
Overlays of Maps from the year of 1779 - and the year the of 2021. The historical map from 1779 depicts the region of Philadelphia between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. During this time, Philadelphiaâ€™s urban fabric was limited in extent; the street grid extended to only around the modern-day Old City neighborhood. The less developed land was depicted to be open space, family farms, and homes.
